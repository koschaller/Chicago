# Chicago

######
This is a data exploratory analysis of census information and public school metrics, provided by the City of Chicago. I initially created a database using postgreSQL to explore the data. Then connected the database to a Jupyter notebook to calculcate correlations between variables and to visualize data with various plots and charts. 

Used aggregate calculations, joins, CTE's, CASE statements, and subqueries in SQL. Used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and ipython-sql in python.
